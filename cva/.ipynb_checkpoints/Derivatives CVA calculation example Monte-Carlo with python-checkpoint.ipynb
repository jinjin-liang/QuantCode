    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we’ll show an example of code for CVA calculation (credit valuation adjustment) using python and Quantlib with simple Monte-Carlo method with portfolio consisting just of a single interest rate swap.It’s easy to generalize code to include more financial instruments , supported by QuantLib python Swig interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "CVA calculation algorithm:\n",
    "1) Simulate yield curve at future dates\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Calculate your derivatives portfolio NPV (net present value) at each time point for each scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Calculate CVA as sum of Expected Exposure multiplied by probability of default at this interval\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CVA=(1−R)∫DF(t)EE(t)dQt$$\n",
    "where R is Recovery (normally set to 40%) EE(t) expected exposure at time t and dQ survival probability density , DF(t) discount factor at time t\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline\n",
    "1) In this simple example we will use Hull White model to generate future yield curves. In practice many banks use some yield curve evolution models based on historical simulations.\n",
    "In Hull White model short rate\n",
    "$r_t$\n",
    "is distributed normally with known mean and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) For each point of time we will generate whole yield curve based on short rate. Then we will price our interest rate swap on each of these curves.\n",
    "after\n",
    "\n",
    "3) to approximate CVA we will use BASEL III formula for regulatory capital charge approximating default probability [or survival probability ] as exp(-ST/(1-R))\n",
    "so we get\n",
    "$$CVA=(1−R)\\sum\\frac{EE^∗_{T_i}+EE^∗_{T_{i−1}} }{2}\\left(e^{−\\frac{ ST_{i−1}}{1−R} }−e^{−\\frac{ST_i}{1−R} }\\right)^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "$EE^*$ is discounted Expected exposure of portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "Details\n",
    "For this first example we’ll take 5% flat forward yield curve. In the second test example below we’ll take full curve as of 26/12/2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Hull-White model for future yield curve simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "the model is given by dynamics:\n",
    "$$dr_rt=(\\theta_t−ar_t)dt+\\sigma dW_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use that in Hull White model short rate $r_t$ is distributed normally with mean and variance given by\n",
    "$$E(r_t|r_s)=r_se^{−a(t−s)}+\\gamma t−\\gamma_se^{−a(t−s)}$$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$$Var(r_t|r_s)=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2a}\\left(1−e^{−2a(t−s)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\\gamma_t=f_t(0)+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2a}\\left(1−e^{−at}\\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $f_t(0)$ is instantaneous forward rate at time t as seen at time 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations will not depend on $\\theta_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate future values of $r_t$,  first we will generate matrix of standard normal variables using numpy library function numpy.random.standard_normal().After that we will apply transform\n",
    "$$mean+\\sqrt{variance}Normal(0,1)$$\n",
    "to get $rt$\n",
    "\n",
    "after getting matrix of all $r_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all simulations and time points we will construct yield curve for each $r_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "using Hull White discount factors\n",
    "$$P_{->T}(t)=A(t,T)e^{−B(t,T)r_t}$$\n",
    "for 20 years and store each yield curve in matrix crvMat\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Valuing portfolio\n",
    "On each of this curve we will value swap using QuantLib function. you can add more financial instruments just by adding its value to global NPV\n",
    "\n",
    "For our exzample portfolio we’ll take one interest rate swap EUR 10MM notional receiving 5% every 6m , TARGET calendar, with 5 years maturity.\n",
    "Actual/360 daycounter for both legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) CVA calculation\n",
    "After getting matrix of all NPV at each point for each simulation we will replace negative values with 0.\n",
    "Then we average each column of the matrix (corresponding to averaging for each time point) to get Expected Exposure.\n",
    "and finally calculate CVA as sum as in BASEL 3 formula.\n",
    "here we’ll take 500bps flat CDS spread."
